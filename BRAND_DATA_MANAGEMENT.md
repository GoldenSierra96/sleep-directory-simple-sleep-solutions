# ðŸ’¤ Sleep Directory: Brand Data Management Workflow

## Overview
This guide explains how to manage brand data in your Sleep Directory project, including:
- Seeding the database with brands (including test data like "Not Swiss Cheese")
- Adding/editing brands via the admin UI or directly in the database
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Best practices and suggested team workflows

---

## 1. Environment Setup
- Ensure your `.env` file contains the correct `DATABASE_URL` (Session Pooler connection string from Supabase).
- Example:
  ```
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.<user>@aws-0-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
  ```

---

## 2. Seeding Brand Data

### A. Edit the Seed Script
- The seed script is at: `prisma/seed.ts`
- Add or edit brand entries in this file using the Prisma client, e.g.:
  ```ts
  await prisma.brand.create({
    data: {
      name: "Not Swiss Cheese",
      slug: "not-swiss-cheese",
      // ...other fields
    }
  });
  ```

### B. Run the Seed Script
1. Make sure dependencies are installed:
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev tsx
   ```
2. Ensure your `package.json` has:
   ```json
   "prisma": {
     "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
   }
   ```
3. Run the seed:
   ```sh
   npx prisma db seed
   ```
- Check the terminal for success messages or errors.
- Verify in Supabase Table Editor that brands are present.

---

## 3. Managing Brands via the Admin UI
- Go to `/admin/brands` in your app (sign in as an admin if required).
- Use the UI to:
  - Add new brands
  - Edit existing brands
  - Delete brands
- Changes are reflected immediately in the database and on the public `/brands` page.

---

## 4. Manual Brand Data Entry (Advanced)
- You can also add/edit brands directly in the Supabase Table Editor.
- Be careful with unique fields (`slug`, `name`) to avoid conflicts.
- Always refresh your app after manual changes.

---

## 5. Brand Data Fields (Reference)
Each brand should have:
- `name` (string, unique)
- `slug` (string, unique, URL-friendly)
- `logo` (URL or path)
- `description` (string)
- `websiteUrl` (URL)
- `tags` (array of strings)
- `locations` (array of strings)
- `isOnline` (boolean)
- `socialLinks` (JSON: instagram, facebook, tiktok, etc.)
- `featured` (boolean)
- `awards` (array of strings)
- `productGallery` (array of image URLs)
- `categories` (relation to categories)

---

## 6. Troubleshooting
- **No brands showing up?**
  - Check your `.env` for the correct `DATABASE_URL`.
  - Make sure you seeded the correct database.
  - Check for errors in the seed script output.
- **Seed script not running?**
  - Ensure you have `tsx` installed and the correct `prisma.seed` config in `package.json`.
  - Run `npx prisma db seed` and check for logs.
- **Database connection errors?**
  - Double-check your Supabase project is running and your password is correct.
  - Test with DBeaver or another client.
- **Unique constraint errors?**
  - Make sure `name` and `slug` are unique for each brand.

  4. Periodically review and update brand data for accuracy.

### B. **Technical Maintenance**

  3. Monitor for errors in logs and address database connection issues.
  4. Keep dependencies up to date and `.env` secure.

### C. **Admin Moderation**
- **Responsibility:** Admin/Moderator Team
- **Workflow:**
  1. Approve or reject new brand submissions (if user-submitted brands are enabled).
