How to Choose the Best Pillow
Consider your sleep position: Back, side, or stomach sleepers need different levels of support.

Check the material: Memory foam, latex, down, and synthetic fills each offer unique benefits.

Look for hypoallergenic options: Especially important if you suffer from allergies.

Assess firmness: Choose a firmness that matches your comfort preferences and support needs.

Read customer reviews: Real user experiences can help you make an informed decision.

Check for trial periods: Some brands offer sleep trials so you can test at home.

Consider maintenance: Look for pillows with removable, washable covers for easy care.

The Science Behind Pillows
Choosing the right pillow is about more than comfort—it’s about health. Pillows are engineered to support your head and neck, maintaining proper alignment of the cervical spine. This alignment is crucial for reducing pressure points, preventing pain, and minimising disturbances throughout the night.

Materials like memory foam and latex are designed to respond to body heat and weight, providing customised support that adapts as you move. Down and synthetic fills offer plush comfort while promoting airflow to keep you cool.

Clinical studies show that using a pillow tailored to your sleep position can significantly improve sleep quality and reduce morning discomfort. Experts recommend replacing your pillow every 18–24 months to ensure ongoing support and hygiene.
