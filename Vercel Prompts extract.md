Advanced Filtering - By type, price range, and other relevant attributes
Buying Guides - Related educational content for each category
FAQ Sections - Addressing common questions about each product type
Newsletter Signup - For category-specific deals and updates
SEO Schema Markup
I've implemented a robust SEO schema component that can be used across all pages with different schema types:

Organization Schema - For the homepage
ItemList Schema - For category listing pages
Product Schema - For individual product pages
Article Schema - For blog posts
BreadcrumbList Schema - For navigation paths
The schema markup includes:

Proper structured data for search engines
Rich snippets for improved SERP visibility
Breadcrumb navigation paths

SeoSchema Component - A reusable component that generates appropriate schema markup based on page type
Product Category Layout - A consistent layout for all product category pages
Product Category Pages - Individual pages for each product category with unique content
